## Getting Setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed. The Node version should match [the `engine` version here](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/package.json).

### Xcode Version

Currently we require developers to use Xcode 12, with the latest version (12.2.0) recommended. You can find all versions of Xcode from [Apple's Developer Portal üîê](http://developer.apple.com/download/more/).

### Clone

Follow the instructions in [the README](https://github.com/artsy/eigen).

### Running Tests

We can only run tests in one specific environment, today that is iPhone 12 Pro with the iOS 14.2 Simulator. This is because we use visual snapshots for UI regressions.

#### To run test in Xcode

Tap `cmd + u` to run all tests, use `ctrl + alt + cmd + g` to run the last set you clicked on via the GUI.

#### Command line

You can run tests via the CLI using:

```sh
make test
```

#### Updating snapshots

We use [Nimble-Snapshots](https://github.com/ashfurrow/Nimble-Snapshots) to take screenshots while running tests and
these screenshots are checked in to the source control. When you change e.g. the background color of a particular
button, it calculates the diff between two screenshots and makes the test fail if the delta is above a certain
threshold.

In order to update existing screenshots, run './scripts/record-snapshots-enable.sh`. This will do some small edits in the `Pods/`directory. After that you can run the tests again, using`cmd+u`. They will fail again but they will generate the new snapshots. Now run the second script `./scripts/record-snapshots-disable.sh`, which will revert the changes. Now run the tests again using `cmd+u` and tests should pass.

If you are still having some tests failing, try commenting out the failing line, run the test, and comment in the line again and run again. If that still fails, then try replacing `haveValidSnapshot` with `recordSnapshot`, run test, go back to `haveValidSnapshot`, run test again. Hopefully that would fix all your failing tests.

### Certificates

We use Xcode's auto-codesigning. It should magically "just work" if you log in to Xcode with an iTunes account
which is on the Artsy team.

We have [cert troubleshooting here](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/docs/certs.md)

### Connecting a device

Xcode will prompt you to join a team, then to enable the device for development. When If you have to choose a team, choose _Art.sY Inc._.
