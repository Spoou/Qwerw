# Test your new features on a real device

To test your new features on a real device you can create a beta version.

To create a beta version, you need to checkout the branch that has the changes (or `main` branch if the changes are already merged) and run

```
./scripts/deploy-both
```

and soon you will have betas on testflight and firebase
