# How to Develop a Feature in Eigen

Developing new features in Eigen can be a little tricky. For very small features (like adding a single new label to a view), just send a pull request. For big features that will take longer than a sprint, things are a little more complicated.

[Artsy releases the app on a 2-week cadence üîê](https://www.notion.so/artsy/2-week-Release-Cadence-f3427549d9cb4d8b809ad16c57338c2d), submitting the Monday after a sprint starts. We want engineers and stakeholders to be able to ship and test work without making in progress work visible to our users. To support this, new features are put behind **feature flags**.

A feature flag in eigen is simply a boolean value that decides whether a particular feature should be available in the app. Whether this value is 'true' or 'false' depends on two things:

- Whether the feature is ready for release.
- Whether the feature has been added to our remote feature configuration service [echo](https://github.com/artsy/echo).

To illustrate how these two work together, let's go through an example scenario.

## Adding a feature flag

Let's say you want to add a new feature, called "Marketing Banners". We'll add a new feature flag called `ARShowMarketingBanner` (this naming is a convention we borrow from Objective-C).

In the file `features.ts`

```diff
   AROptionsNewFirstInquiry: {
     readyForRelease: true,
     echoFlagKey: "AROptionsNewFirstInquiry",
   },
+  ARShowMarketingBanner: {
+    readyForRelease: false,
+    description: "Show new marketing banners",
+  },
   AROptionsInquiryCheckout: {
     readyForRelease: false,
     description: "Enable inquiry checkout",
   }
```

Adding the `description` property makes it possible to override the feature flag from the admin menu.

You can access the feature flag in a functional react component using `useFeatureFlag`.

```diff
+ const showBanner = useFeatureFlag("ARShowMarketingBanner")
  return (
    <>
      <TitleView />
      <SummaryView />
+     { showBanner && <MarketingBanner /> }
    <>
  )
```

If you need to use the feature flag outside of a functional react component, use `unsafe_getFeatureFlag("ARShowMarketingBanner")`. This is marked as unsafe because it will not cause react components to re-render, but it safe to use in non-reactive contexts, like an `onPress` handler.

## Releasing a feature

When your feature is ready for release, the simplest way to do that is to set `readyForRelease` to `true` in `features.ts`.

```diff
   ARShowMarketingBanner: {
-    readyForRelease: false,
+    readyForRelease: true,
     description: "Show new marketing banners",
   },
```

Alternatively, or at some point in the future, you can simply delete the feature flag and all the conditional branches associated with it.

However, often for complex features we want the ability to turn the feature off if something goes horribly wrong. To provide that ability, you should add an echo flag with the same name. [Here's an example PR for how to do that](https://github.com/artsy/echo/pull/70/files).

After adding the echo key, when you mark the feature as being ready for release you can declare the key.

```diff
   ARShowMarketingBanner: {
-    readyForRelease: false,
+    readyForRelease: true,
+    echoFlagKey: "ARShowMarketingBanner"
     description: "Show new marketing banners",
   },
```

With this setup, the echo flag will be the source of truth for whether or not to enable the feature. You can turn the echo flag off or on to control the feature for all users.

<em>üí° If you make Echo changes, you can update the local bundled copy of the echo settings by running `./scripts/update-echo` in Eigen. This is done automatically when running `pod install`. The app also fetches the latest echo config for itself when launching, so you shouldn't need to do this manually.</em>

## QAing
